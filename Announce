Hi to all of you careful bug hunters and happy hackers reading this message!

It is my pleasure to announce the result of four years of hard development
work: the first release candidate for $(focal).

(0) What is it ?
----------------

$(focal) is an integrated development environment to write high integrity
programs and systems. It provides a purely functional language to formally
express specifications, describe the design and code the algorithms.
Within the functional language, $(focal) provides a logical framework to
express the properties of the code. A simple declarative language provides
the natural expression of proofs of properties them from within the program 
source code.

The $(focal) compiler extracts statements and proof scripts from the source
file, to pass them to the Zenon proof generator to produce Coq proof terms
that are then formally verified.

The $(focal) compiler also generates the code corresponding to the
program as an Objective Caml source file. This way, programs developped in
$(focal) can be efficiently compiled to native code on a large variety of
architectures.

Last but not least, $(focal) automatically generates the documentation
corresponding to the development, a requirement for high evaluation
assurance.

The $(focal) system provides means for the developers to formally express
their specifications and to go step by step (in an incremental approach) to
design and implementation, while proving that such an implementation
meets its specification or design requirements. The $(focal) language offers
high level mechanisms such as inheritance, late binding, redefinition,
parametrization, etc.  Confidence in proofs submitted by developers or
automatically done relies on Coq formal proof verification. 

$(focal) is a son of the previous Focal system. However, it is a completely
new implementation with vastly revised syntax and semantices, featuring a
rock-solid infrastructure and greatly improved capabilities.

(1) Where to find it ?
----------------------
$(focal) home page is http://$(focal).inria.fr/
$(focal) source files can be found at
http://$(focal).inria.fr/download/$(PROJECT_NAME_FULL).tgz

(2) How to install it ?
-----------------------
Uncompress, extract, then read the INSTALL file in the newly created
directory focalize.0.1.rc0 and follow the simple instructions written there.

(3) How to join people and discussions ?
----------------------------------------
focalize-users@inria.fr
focalize-devel@inria.fr
focalize-bugs@inria.fr

Enjoy.

For the entire $(focal) implementor group,

Pierre Weis.
