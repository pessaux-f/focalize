################

- Termination proofs by measure and by order.
- Termination proofs (order/measure) now typechecked correctly.
  Before, there was no verification on the expression used as order or measure,
  and on the argument's type used.
- Fixed exception not handled (turned in an error message) for decreasing
  ident not a function argument in termination proofs.
- Order relations on orders are not anymore called <0x, <=0x etc, but simply
  <, <= etc.
- Simplifications in the generated code for collections. Use of implicit
  arguments in right number instead of full types/expression. Makes the
  generated code shorter and more readable.
- Don't require Zenon source code to be present in a zenon subfolder
- Fixed bug in the parser causing collision between documentation comments
  and delimited identifiers.
- New Dedukti back-end as logical target language (in development). Only
  active using the --experimental option.
- Adapt to Coq >= 8.5.
- Misc buf fixes (68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76).
