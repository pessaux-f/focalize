Installation in brief:
======================

The FoCaLize installation is a two steps process, it needs two places where
to permanently install files:

(1) a directory writable during the configuration phase,

(2) a directory writable during the installation phase.

Directory (1) is typically ~/pkg (hence writable for you).
Directory (2) is typically /usr/local (hence, on writable for root).

Directory (1) is the argument of the -share-prefix option of configure.
Directory (2) is the argument of the -prefix option of configure.

In directory (1), the configuration phase builds and installs three external
systems Objective Caml, CamlP5 and the Coq system. Internal tools zenon and
zvtov will also install there.

In directory (2) the installation phase installs the focalizec compiler, its
library and documentation.

All the tools in directory (1) and (2) are mandatory to use the FocaLize system.

Details on installation:
========================

The software will compile and install in three phases in turn:
 (1) Installation of mandatory external tools: Ocaml, Camlp5, Coq.
 (2) Installation of mandatory internal tools: zenon, zvtov.
     Compilation of the compiler focalizec and its libraries.
 (3) Installation of the compiler: focalizec.

The command "./configure ~/pkg" performs task (1).
The command "make" performs task (2).
The command "make install" performs task (3): it installs the compiler, its
libraries, and the documentation.

External and internal tools are installed in the file system in a directory
private to the actual version of the focalizec compiler. Default directory is
<directory>/focalize-0.1.rc0/, where <directory> is fixed when calling
"./configure". For instance, if you want to install in sub-directory pkg of
your home directory, configure using:

./configure ~/pkg

After installation:
===================
For checking the proofs with coqc, add this to your $HOME/.coqrc file:
  Add LoadPath $PATH_TO_ZENON_LIB
  Default for PATH_TO_ZENON_LIB is $SHARE_INSTALL_DIR/lib/zenon,
  normally "/usr/local/focalize.0.1/lib/zenon".
If you specified an alternate libdir when configuring focalize, you will
need to adjust this path accordingly.

Optional prerequisites:
=======================
 - ImageMagick (optional)
 - Ghostscript (optional)
