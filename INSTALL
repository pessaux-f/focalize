(0) Forewords:
==============

The installation of the FoCaLiZe will setup 3 components:
 - The Zenon automatic prover
 - The Zvtov converter of proofs to various theorem provers
 - The FoCaLiZe compiler tool suit (compiler, dependencies checker, inheritance
   graph viewer, testing tool).

Installation requires some external tools, the most emblematic ones being:
 - OCaml (any recent version -- >= 3.11 --) should be fine.
 - Coq (any recent version -- >= 8.1pl5 --) should be fine.

Some the minor (but still needed) tools are also required (LaTeX, make, dvipdf,
dvips) but are generally part of a standard installation on a development
machine.


(1) Quick Installation:
=======================

For hurry people, assuming default installation settings/directories from
the toplevel 'focalize' directory run:
  make all

When prompt, enter your password to allow installer to write in installation
directories (usage of the 'sudo' command).


(2) After installation:
========================

If you version of Coq is older than 8.4, you'll need to invoque the FoCaLiZe
compiler, 'focalizec' with the option:
  -coq_older_8_4
to ensure the generated Coq code is compliant with your version. Note that the
configuration process will have warned you about this point.


(3) Custom Installation:
========================

By default, configuration scripts run silently as long a they find suitable
versions of the required tools. They install software in subdirectories of
'/usr/local' ('lib', 'bin', 'share', 'man').

If for any reason, you want to change installation directories or use versions
of the tools different from the ones in your PATH, then you may manually
configure, build and install the 3 components, following the scheme:

From the toplevel 'focalize' directory:
  ./configure
  cd zenon
  ./configure
  make all
  make doc
  make install
  cd ../zvtov
  ./configure
  make all
  make doc
  make install
  cd ../focalizec
  ./configure
  make depend
  make world
  make doc
  make install

That's it ;)

Scripts 'configure' can be provided tuning options:
* focalize/configure:
  [-]-interactive: run interactively, asking questions.
  [-]-tools_prefix <directory>:  set <directory> as the directory prefix where
      tools required to build FoCaLiZe are installed. The currently required
      non-common tools are OCaml and Coq.
* focalize/zenon/configure:
  [-]-interactive: run interactively, asking questions.
  [-]-install_prefix <directory>: set <directory> as the directory prefix for
      installation of the FoCaLize commands. (Default value for <directory>
      is /usr/local).
* focalize/zvtov/configure: Same than for focalize/zenon/configure.
* focalize/focalizec/configure:
  [-]-interactive: run interactively, asking questions.
  [-]-install_prefix <directory>: set <directory> as the directory prefix for
      installation of the FoCaLize commands. (Default value for <directory> is
      /usr/local).
  [-]-tools_prefix <directory>: set <directory> as the directory prefix where
      tools required to build FoCaLiZe are installed. The currently required
      tools (other than OCaml and Coq already configured) are zenon, zvtov.
