Compile and install with:
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Since the configuration step requires the compilation of Objective Caml,
Camp5, and Coq, expect this step to take some time!

If the default configuration settings do not please you, you may use more
suitable configuration options.

If you want to run the script interactively, use:

./configure -interactive

If you already know what you are doing, you can fix the external tools
installation directory with:

./configure -tools_prefix <directory>

or independently fix the tools and project installation directories with:

./configure -tools_prefix <directory> -prefix <directory>

For even finer configuration, get more information from the script with:

./configure -help | more

or see below to understand the configuration process.

Installation in brief:
======================

The FoCaLiZe installation is a three steps process: configuration, building (run "make") and installation of executables and
documentation (run "make install").

The installation process needs two places where to permanently install files:

(1) a directory writable during the configuration and building phase,

(2) a directory writable during the installation phase.

Directory (1) is typically ~/pkg (hence writable by you).
Directory (2) is typically /usr/local (hence only writable by root).

Directory (1) is the argument of the -tools_prefix option of configure.
Directory (2) is the argument of the -prefix option of configure.

In directory (1), the building phase builds and installs three external
systems: Objective Caml, CamlP5 and the Coq system. Internal tools, zenon and
zvtov, will also install there.

In directory (2) the installation phase installs the focalizec compiler, its
library and documentation.

All the tools in directory (1) and (2) are mandatory to use the FoCaLize system.

Details on installation:
========================

The software will compile and install in three tasks in turn:

 (1) Configuration.

 (2) - Compilation and installation of mandatory externals tools:
       Ocaml, Camlp5, and Coq.
     - Compilation and installation of internal tools: zenon and zvtov.
     - Compilation of the compiler focalizec and its libraries.

 (3) Installation of the compiler: focalizec.

The command "./configure ~/pkg" performs task (1).
The command "make" performs task (2).
The command "make install" performs task (3): it installs the compiler, its
libraries, and the documentation.

External and internal tools are installed in the file system in a directory
private to the actual version of the focalizec compiler. Default directory is
sub directory "focalize-0.6.0" in the directory "~/pkg"; you can change this
behavior during step 1, by calling "./configure <directory>".
For instance, if you want to install the external tools in the directory
"/usr/local/focalize-0.6.0", configure using:

./configure "/usr/local"

After installation:
===================
For checking the proofs with coqc, you need to add this to your $HOME/.coqrc file:
  Add LoadPath $TOOLS_INSTALL_DIR/lib.
  Add LoadPath $TOOLS_INSTALL_DIR/lib/zenon.

The default $TOOLS_INSTALL_DIR is "/usr/local/lib/focalize-0.6.0"; If you specified
an alternate --tools_installation_prefix when configuring FoCaLiZe, you need
to adjust these paths accordingly.

Optional prerequisites:
=======================
 - ImageMagick (optional)
 - Ghostscript (optional)
