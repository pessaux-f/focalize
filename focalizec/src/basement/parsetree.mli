(** {2 The FoCaLiZe abstract syntax tree} *)

(** The parse tree, or shallow abstract syntax.
   Disambiguation has not yet been done.
   This is the input type of the disambiguation pass.
   The disambiguation pass has to resolve global/local/method
   classification for idents.

   We use a short list of abbreviations in the naming of this file:
   - "ast" means Abstract Syntax Tree,
   - "loc" means location (a way to find the file and the place in the file
   where a given syntax tree has been read),
   - "desc" means description (the semantical classification of the node;
      generally speaking it is a field of a record and it contains a value of
      another (sum) type that lists the complete set of classification),
   - "def" means definition as in "type_def" for ``type definition'',
   - "expr" means expression as in "type_expr" for ``type expression'',
   - "param" means parameter.

(** {3 The generic polymorphic type of AST nodes} *)

(** {6 Parsed comments} *)

(** AST supports annotation (including documentation) for programs.

    Annotation elements are particular (parenthesized) comments of the
    language, so that they can be safely ignored by the compiler.

    An annotation is a list of such annotation elements.

    Although similar to lists of comments of the language, annotations are
    indeed parsed: they may not appear anywhere in the program but only in
    specified places as specified by the grammar of the language.

    Roughly speaking, annotation nodes are allowed in each ``important''
    construct, before the keyword that introduces the construct.
    The contents of annotation elements is free style, provided that the
    annotation element is also a legal language comment (hence, the usual end
    of comment marker of the language cannot appear in an annotation element).

    Annotations are handy to drive extra compiler processing passes that can
    parse the annotation elements to process the program accordingly.
    The FoCaLiZe automatic documentation processor works axactly that way to
    produce documentation from annotated programs. More sophisticated
    processors may produce new programs that may be fed back to the compiler.

    Note that an empty list of annotation elements stands for no
    annotation at all. *)
type annotation = annot_elem list
and annot_elem = {
  ae_loc : Location.t;
  ae_desc : string; (** The contents of the annotation. *)
  ae_tag : string; (** The tag to designate which processor is concerned. *)
}

(** {6 Type information provision in the AST} *)

(** Description of the type-checking information available in AST nodes.

    For simplicity, we keep the same AST structure during the entire
    compilation process. The parser builds the initial abstract syntax tree
    with the minimum information; each successive pass of the compiler then
    enriches its tree argument with the information it collects. In
    particular, the type checker decorates the tree with type information
    annotations. The type [ast_node_type_information] classifies the type
    information stored in the AST nodes. *)

type ast_node_type_information =
   | ANTI_none
     (** The node has not yet been visited by the type-checker. *)
   | ANTI_irrelevant
     (** The node has been visited by the type-checker but there is no
     meaningful type information to provide here. *)
   | ANTI_type of Types.type_simple
     (** The type information is a type. *)
   | ANTI_scheme of Types.type_scheme
     (** The type information is a type scheme. *)

(** Note: after the type-checking pass, no AST node should still have the
    [Anti_none] kind of type information. *)

(** {6 The polymorphic AST data structure} *)

(** The polymorphic AST node contains the mandatory information for all AST
    nodes: the location of the node, the annotation for the node, the type
    of the node, and a description for the node which is left unspecified as a
    polymorphic type variable at this level of description.
    The polymorphic type variable gives us provision for any kind of
    description type for the nodes: either sum type, record type, or
    abbreviation type; we also accept any visibility for the node description
    type, being it either public, private, or abstract. *)
