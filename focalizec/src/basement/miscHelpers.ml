(** ****************************************************************************
    {b Descr} : Because methods parameters do not have their type scheme with
    them in the [species_description]s, this function establishes the mapping
    between the parameters names and their related type extracted from the
    method's scheme.
    It dissecates method's the type scheme (more accurately, AND NOT an instance
    of it), "removing" arrows parameter after parameter.
    Because the typechecking pass is already done, the FoCaLize program is
    well-typed, hence, the type of the method must have "as many arrows as"
    the method has parameters. If this is not the case, then we have a bug
    somewhere else in the previous processes in the compiler.

    This function hence returns the list giving for each parameter name its
    type and the "result" type of the method (i.e. the type remaining after
    having "removed all the arrows" induced by the parameters).
    It also returns the list of generalized type variables of the type scheme.

    ATTENTION: OLD STRANGE STUFF WE HAD TO FIX AND SEEMS TO WORK FINE NOW
    EVEN HAVING REMOVED THE CODE HANDLING THIS FIX:
      Before, we had a bug  forcing us to keep trace of variables marked as
      generalized but that are bound by a hosting definition and are in fact
      only polymorphic in the context of this hosting definition.
      The fix allowed to avoid generating spurious explicit polymorphic
      parameters in case they were already generated because the polymorphism
      comes from identifiers of this hosting definition.
      For instance, in the case of:
        let f(xx, yy) =
          let zz = (xx, yy) in
          yy
      the polymorphism of xx and yy is handled at the point of definition of f.
      Hence, f will need extra arguments, but not zz ! Not taking care of this
      would make us generating wrong code like:
        Let f (__var_a : Set) (__var_b : Set) (xx : __var_a) (yy : __var_b) :
          __var_b :=
          let zz (__var_a : Set) (__var_b : Set) : ((__var_b * __var_a)%type) :=
            (xx, yy) in
          yy.
      where zz has 2 spurious extra parameters, (__var_a : Set) and
      (__var_b : Set).
