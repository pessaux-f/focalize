(not seen yet : all about relation [in lib]
     	      	the main directory files)


Do not modify Renaud's libraries (listes.fcl and coll.fcl)
But remove the useless one (which is ?)


Rename "utils" as "relation" (be careful, there is relation (without self),
and relations (with self), there is some "s" to remove among species' names)


Clean finite set (don't forget to use Renaud's list library)


Link correctly the libraries' files
And check names which (may) have been changed


Make a better "extended product" library (for instance with the proofs)
Cf cartesian product (stdlib)


Solve the basics#( = ) vs Self!( = ) vs Self!equal problem
(conflict between some libraries)


DOCUMENT EVERYTHING !!!!
