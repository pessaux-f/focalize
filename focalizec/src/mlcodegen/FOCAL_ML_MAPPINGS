In function/methods identifiers, translation of the special characters from
FoCaL names toward OCaml names.

In type identifiers, translation from FoCaL types names toward OCaml types
names:
  "_focty_" + name of the FoCaL type

In species, lambda-lifted methods from species paramaters called in a species
method:
  "_p_" + species parameter's name + "_" + called method's name

In species, lambda-lifted methods from the current species called in a species
method:
  "abst_" + called method's name

In a species, name of the record type representing this species:
  "me_as_species"

In a species, type variable representing our carrier:
  "'abst_T"

In a species, in its record type, names of the methods of this species:
  uncapitalized name of the species + "_" + name of the method

In a species, type variables names representing the species parameters carriers:
  "'" + uncapitalized name of the species parameter +
  a unique int in this type + "_T"

In collection generator, name of the local function to assign in the record
value bucket of a method:
  "local_" + name of the method

In a collection, name of the value representing the effective collection's
instance:
  "effective_collection"

The "prop" type is hardwired-mapped onto the ML-equvalent of bool, i.e. onto
the "Basics._focty_bool". In effect, the mapping of bool is assumed to be in
the "basics.foc" file. The problem is that we can't really "define" "prop"
in the file "basic.foc" because "prop" is a keyword. This only impacts the
function [rec_pp] inside the function [pp_type_simple_to_ml] in the
"basement/types.ml" file.
