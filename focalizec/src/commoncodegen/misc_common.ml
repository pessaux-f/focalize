      - [IPI_by_species_parameter] : The species parameter was instanciated
        by a species parameter of the species who inherits. In this case,

    Once the process ends, we return the description of by what the initial
    species parameter was really instanciated all along the inheritance.
    ATTENTION: in case of instanciation by a toplevel species, we return
    the species used to instanciate the parameter, but we still need
    afterwards to exactly find in which parent of this species each method
    we have dependencies on was REALLY defined. This job has to be done after
    getting the result of this function. This is architectured like this to
    allow preventing to compute several times instanciations when they appear
    to be done by toplevel collections or species parameters.

    {b Args} :
    - [ctx] : The current OCaml code generation context.

    - [env] : The current OCaml code generation environment.

    - [original_param_index] : The index of the species parameter in the
      original species where the method was REALLY defined (not the one
      where it is inherited). We search by what it was instanciated along
      the inheritance. Hence, the search starts from the original hosting
      species, with the original hosting species's parameter's index. Then
      we go upward (more recent) along the inheritance tree.

    - [inheritance_steps] : The inheritance history describing where the
      currently processed method was defined and how it is propagated by
      inheritance up to the currently compiled species. In head are the most
      recent steps, in tail the older. This list will be processed in reverse
      order to "go back to the future".

    that the instanciation process (during collection generator creation)
    reported us to be the effective instanciation of a species parameter.

    The example below show shuch a case:

    species Sp0 = let m = 5 ; end ;;
    species Sp1 inherits Sp0 = rep = int ; let n = 5 ; end ;;
    species Foo0 (A0 is Sp0) = rep = int ; let v = A0!m ; end ;;

         let local_v = Foo0.v Sp0.m.
    In effect, the method generator for the method 'm' on which we depend
    if not really in 'Sp1' ('Sp1' is the effective instanciation of the
    parameter 'Sp0' of 'Foo0' during inheritance in 'Foo1_1_1').
    The method generator is in the parent of 'Sp1', i.e. 'Sp0'.
