(** {b Descr} : Data structure to record the various stuff needed to generate
      the Caml/Coq/Dedukti code for a species definition. Passing this structure
      prevents from recursively passing a bunch of parameters to the functions.
      Instead, one pass only one and functions use the fields they need. This
      is mostly to preserve the stack and to make the code more readable. In
      fact, information recorded in this structure is semantically pretty
      un-interesting to understand the compilation process: it is
      more utilities.

      [toplevel_compile] function and never modified or updated during code
      generation recursions. Hence, please do not change this assumption since
      nobody pass a modified context to a recursive call. Please, keep the
      usage of this structure simple this way.
