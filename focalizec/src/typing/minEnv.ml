              The question is won't it bring a non-existing def-dep on rep
              in computational code although this dep was initially brought
              by a dependency on a logical method?
              The answer is no. In effect, either the currently processed
              method is really computational and in this case there have been
              some where a real unification since computational can't depend
              on logical methods. Or we are processing a logical method, and
              in this case anyway all the kind of dependencies must be taken
              into account! *)
