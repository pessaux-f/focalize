Makefile.spec :
    tests lexicographic_product_additive_monoid with small_naturals for both
    instances parameters.

Makefile.parameters :
    tests lexicographic_product_additive_monoid with parameters :
     - parameter total_degree_reverse_lexicographic_ordering(small_naturals)
     - small_naturals

The both Makefile use actually the definitions
- lexicographic_product_additive_monoid_print,
- lexicographic_product_additive_monoid_print2
- total_degree_reverse_lexicographic_ordering_print
which modify the print function of the species for better pretty printing.
