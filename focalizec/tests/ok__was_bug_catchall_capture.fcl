(** Must pass. Illustrate the need to reset the catchall renamer (for Coq code)
    *not before each pattern*. Ths caused the same "fresh" variable used several
    times in case of some nested pattern-matchings. Hence the last bound
    variable was hidding the previous one, causing the generated Coq to be
