(* Must pass.
   Example showing simple mutually recursive functions.
   However, on Coq side, the {struct x} hack is to weak to get the termination
   OK. Hence, that's normal that Coq complains like:
    Recursive call to odd has principal argument equal to
    basics.pred x instead of a subterm of x.
    This should be fixed once termination proofs will be corretly integrated. *)
