* types_d_especes_alleges :
    Just after having simplified the type of species in order not to have
    anymore in double [Env....species_description] and [Types.type_species].

* avant_especes_param_par_self :
    Just before adding ability of parametrising a species by Self.

* release_interne_pour_etudiants_M1_mathieu :
    Tag of the version working in OCaml for nearly all the standard library and
    for ensembles_finis.foc. This will allow Mathieu's M1 students starting to
    use the new compiler for their internship.
    Coq still sucks a bit: I identified a boring 3-facets bug abou
    in-parameters in Coq (I'll fix this quickly as soon as I have 2 minutes)
    and their remains to end collection generation in Coq.

* avant_suppression_sections:
    Frozen before modification of the Coq code generation pass to remove usage
    of Sections and replace them by a "manual" management of the abstractions.

* marche_16_10_2008:
    Version just before we set equality as a native feature. The next commit
    will make the stdlib non-compilable temporarily. Proofs will have to be
    adapted.

* focalize_release_0_6_0 (07 May 2010):
    For a release that will have never existed :/

* Before_removing_Coq_Function (27 Feb 2012):

* branch_focalize_release_0_1_rc0:
    Branch for release.

* before_config_and_build_revisited  (13 Oct 2012):
    Version just before massive changes in config and build mechanisms.

* 0.8.0 (10 Jan 2013)
    Release 0.8.0.
