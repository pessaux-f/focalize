\index{recursion}
In the current alpha-release, the logical counterpart of recursive
functions is not completely handled for the {\coq} code generation. We
are still working on the point: recursive functions are planed to be
fully supported as soon as possible, in addition with new material to
help writing the required termination proofs.

In the current state \focalize\ provides 2 ways to write recursive
functions depending on whether they involve a structural or general
recursion. The difference in the generated code only affects the
\coq\ code. Recursive structural functions are compiled to the
construct {\tt Fixpoint} of \coq, hence avoiding the user to provide a
termination proof. Functions that are not recursive structural are
currently compiled to the {\tt Function} construct of \coq. Currently,
the termination proof that should be provided by the user is ignored
and turned assumed.

Recursive structural functions are introduced by the {\tt let recstruct}
whereas general recursive functions are introduced by {\tt let rec}.

Mutually recursive functions are currently not supported for \coq\
code generation.
