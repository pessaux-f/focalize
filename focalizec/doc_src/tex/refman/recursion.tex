\index{recursion}

(OUT-OF-DATE:
In the current state {\focal} provides 2 ways to write recursive
functions depending on whether they involve a structural or general
recursion. The difference in the generated code only affects the
{\coq} code. Recursive structural functions are compiled to the
construct {\tt Fixpoint} of {\coq}, hence avoiding the user to provide a
termination proof. Functions that are not recursive structural are
currently compiled to the {\tt Function} construct of {\coq}. Currently,
the termination proof that should be provided by the user is ignored
and turned assumed.)

\medskip
Termination proofs can by {\tt structural ...}, or {\tt order ... on ...}, or
{\tt measure ... on ...}.
Documentation TODO!

\medskip
Mutually recursive functions are currently not supported for {\coq}
code generation.
