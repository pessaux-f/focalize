%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unable to find file '$name$' in the search path.}

{\em Description}: The source file made reference to a {\focal}
compilation unit
$name$ (by the {\tt open} or {\tt use} directives, or by explicit
qualification with the ``\#'' notation) but the related
{\focal} file was not found in the current libraries search
path.

{\em Hints}: Locate in which directory the missing  file is
and add this directory to the libraries search path with the {\tt -I}
compiler option.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Invalid or corrupted compilation unit '$name$'. May be it
  was compiled with another version of the compiler.}
{\em Description}: The source file made reference to a {\focal}
compilation unit
$name$ (by the {\tt open} or {\tt use} directives, or by explicit
qualification with the ``\#'' notation but the related
{\focal}  file was found with an incorrect format.

{\em Hints}: May be the compilation unit was compiled with another
version of {\focal} or was mangled and you must compile it again with
your current version.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Invalid file extension for '$name$'.}
{\em Description}: The {\focal} compiler expects compilation units to be
ended by the suffix ``.fcl'', ``.ml'', ``.mli'', ``.zv''or ``.v''. If
the submitted input file doesn't end by one of these suffixes, this
error message arises with the name, $name$ of the involved file.

{\em Hints}: Change the extension of the input file name or ensure the
submitted input file name is the correct one.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{System error - $sysmsg$.}
{\em Description}: During the compilation process an error related to
the operating system occurred (I/O error, permission error, file-system
error, \ldots). The original message $sysmsg$ of the system explaining
the problem follows the {\focal}'s message.

{\em Hints}: Consult the original message of the system and get an
appropriate solution depending on this message.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Invalid OCaml compiler kind "$string$" for option -ocaml-comp-mode. Must be "byt", "bin" or "both".}
{\em Description}: By default, if some {\ocaml} code was generated, the
{\focal} compiler sends the generated code to the {\ocaml} compiler. The
default compilation mode is bytecode production. It is possible to
select the native code production using the option {\tt -ocaml-comp-mode}
followed by the string ``bin'' or to select both code production modes
by the string ``both''. The argument string ``byt'' is not required
since it is the default mode. Any other string is invalid and leads to
the present error message.

{\em Hints}: Select ``byt'', ``bin'' or ``both'' as argument to the
{\tt -ocaml-comp-mode} option.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{No input file. {\focalizec} is cowardly giving up...}
{\em Description}: The {\focal} compiler needs one input file to
compile. If none is supplied, this error message arises.

{\em Hints}: Add the input source file to compile on the command
line.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Lexical error $str$}
{\em Description}: In the currently submitted source file, a sequence
of characters is not recognised as legal according to the
{\focal} programming language legal words structure. The involved
character $str$ follows in the error message.

{\em Hints}: Change the source code at the indicated location.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Syntax error}
{\em Description}: In the currently submitted source file, a phrase of
the program doesn't follow {\focal}'s syntax.

{\em Hints}: Change the source code at the indicated location. It
sometimes happens that the location gets fuzzy due to the parsing
process. If the error is not immediate to you, explore the neighbours of
 the specified location. If you still can't find out the error,
have the following emergency process: comment your code and
incrementally uncomment it to find the point where the error appears
without having to search in the whole file. Once the error appears,
have a look at the part of code you uncommented since the previous
successful compilation and try to guess the syntactic cause.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unclear syntax error $msg$.}
{\em Description}: An error occurred during the syntactic analysis but
was not reported to be due to a syntax non-compliance. This error is
not clearly identified and this message is displayed as post-mortem
report with the exception $msg$ that caused the error.

{\em Hints}: None



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Compilation unit '$m$' was not declared as "use"}
{\em Description}: It not possible to use a qualified notation for a
compilation unit name (i.e. using an entity from this compilation unit
by explicitly specifying the unit with the ``\#''-notation) before this
compilation unit is declared ``use'' or ``open''. This error message
indicates the location where an identifier refers to a compilation
unit that was not qualified either by the {\tt use} or {\tt open}
directive. Note that the {\tt open} directive implicitly implies
{\tt use}.

{\em Hints}: Use the {\tt use} directive on the compilation detected
unit.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Parameterised species  expected $n_1$ arguments but
  was provided $n_2$.}
{\em Description}: A species expression (used in species parameter
expression or {\tt inherit} clause) applies a species with $n_1$
argument(s) although its definition declared it as using $n_2$
argument(s).

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Non-logical let must not bind '$ident$' to a property.}
{\em Description}: A {\tt let} construct (not a {\tt logical let})
attempts to bind the identifier $ident$ to a logical expression
although it can only bind it to a computational expression.

{\em Hints}: Source program to fix. May be the {\tt let} should be
turned into a {\tt logical let} if the body of the binding is really a
logical expression.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Delayed termination proof refers to an unknown method
  '$ident$' of the species.}
{\em Description}: A {\tt proof of} clause was found in a species for
the property $ident$ but this property was not found in the species.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Ambiguous logical expression. Add explicit parentheses to
  associate the $side$ argument of the \terminal{/\backslash} properly.}
{\em Description}: A logical expression contains a
\terminal{/\backslash} (logical ``and'') with at least one argument being a
\terminal{->} (logical ``implication'') or a \terminal{<->} (logical
``equivalence'') without parentheses around the $side$ argument (``left''
or ``right''). Since this is not clear of how to associate, we  ask
the user to explicitly add parentheses.

{\em Hints}: Explicitly add the parentheses to make the association
non-ambiguous.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Ambiguous logical expression. Add explicit parentheses to
  associate the $side$ argument of the \terminal{\backslash/} properly.}
{\em Description}: A logical expression contains a
\terminal{\backslash/} (logical ``or'') with at least one argument being a
\terminal{->} (logical ``implication'') or a \terminal{<->} (logical
``equivalence'') without parentheses around the $side$ argument (``left''
or ``right''). Since this is not clear of how to associate, we  ask
the user to explicitly add parentheses.

{\em Hints}: Explicitly add the parentheses to make the association
non-ambiguous.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Hypothesis, notation or variable name '$name$' already bound in
  the current scope of the proof.}
{\em Description}: In the current proof, an hypothesis, a notation or a
variable is introduced but there already exists one with this name.

{\em Hints}: Rename the mentionned hypothesis, notation or variable.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{The property '$name$' doesn't belong to a collection but to a
  species.}
{\em Description}: A proof fact attempts to use a property hosted in a species
instead of in a collection. Since only collections are ensuring that properties
they contain hold, only properties from collections can be used to make
proofs. In effect, in a species, a property may only be stated without being
provable. Relying on an unproved property may allow to write wrong proofs.

{\em Hints}: Either you have a collection implementing the species from whom
you are trying to use the proof and then use the property from this collection.
Or have a collection parameter whose interface is the species from whom you
are trying to use the proof and then use the property from this collection
parameter.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Termination proof considers '$name$' as decreasing but it is not
  an argument of the function.}

{\em Description}: A termination proof (either \terminal{by measure} or
\terminal{by order} of a recursive function uses the identifier '$name$'
to pinpoint the decreasing parameter. However, this identifier is not a
parameter of the function.

{\em Hints}: You may got confused in the name of the parameter. Ony one of
the function's parameter can appear at this place.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unbound sum type value constructor '$name$'.}
{\em Description}: An identifier representing a sum type value constructor
was not found among the available sum type definitions.

{\em Hints}: Source program to fix. Since in core expressions
capitalized identifiers are considered as sum type value constructors,
may be you tried to use a capitalized name for one of your
variables. In this case, as any variables, make it starting with a
lowercase letter. Otherwise, may be your type definition is missing or
not reachable in the current scope (missing explicit qualification
with the ``\#'' notation or {\tt open} directive if your type
definition is hosted in another source file).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unbound record type label '$name$'.}
{\em Description}: An identifier representing a record type label
was not found among the available record type definitions.

{\em Hints}: Source program to fix. May be your type definition is
missing or not reachable in the current scope (missing explicit
qualification with the ``\#'' notation or {\tt open} directive if your
type definition is hosted in another source file).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unbound identifier '$name$'.}
{\em Description}: An identifier (expected to be bound by a {\tt let},
a pattern of a function parameter declaration) was not found.

{\em Hints}: Source program to fix. May be your definition should be
toplevel and is missing or not reachable in the current scope (missing
explicit qualification with the ``\#'' notation or {\tt open}
directive if your definition is hosted in another source file).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unbound type '$name$'.}
{\em Description}: The definition of an identifier expected to be a
type constructor was not found.

May be your type definition is missing or not reachable in the current
scope (missing explicit qualification with the ``\#'' notation or
{\tt open} directive if your type definition is hosted in another
source file).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unbound compilation unit '$name$'.}  {\em Description}: A
{\tt open} or {\tt use} directive or an explicit qualification by the
``\#'' notation makes reference to a compilation unit that was not
found in the current libraries search path.

{\em Hints}: Locate in which directory the missing  file is
and add this directory to the libraries search path with the {\tt -I}
compiler option.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unbound species '$name$'.}
{\em Description}: The definition of the species $name$ was not found
in the current scope.

{\em Hints}: May be your species definition is missing or not
reachable in the current scope (missing explicit qualification with
the ``\#'' notation or {\tt open} directive if your species definition is
hosted in another source file).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Species '$name$' is not a collection. Its carrier can't be used in type expressions.}
{\em Description}: A type expression makes reference to the carrier of
either a collection that doesn't exist or a species (which is not a
collection).

{\em Hints}: The common confusion is to consider that a complete species
is like a collection. However, only carriers of collections are allowed
in type expressions. Ensure you didn't make reference to a species instead
of an effective collection.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Type name '$name$' already bound in the current scope.}
{\em Description}: In a source file it is not allowed to redefine a
type definition. This means that each type name definition must be
unique inside a file. However, it is possible to have several type
definitions with the same names as long as they are in different
source files (even if they are used together via {\tt open} directives
of explicit qualification by the ``\#'' notation).

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Species name '$name$' already bound in the current scope.}
{\em Description}: In a source file it is not allowed to redefine a
species definition. This means that each species name definition must
be unique inside a file. However, it is possible to have several species
definitions with the same names as long as they are in different
source files (even if they are used together via {\tt open} directives
of explicit qualification by the ``\#'' notation).

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Types $t_1$ and $t_2$ are not compatible.}
{\em Description}: The typechecking system detected a type conflict
between two expressions $t_1$ and $t_2$ that were expected to be
type-compatible.

{\em Hints}: Source program to fix. This is mostly due to an attempt
to use the type of a {\tt representation} although it is turned
abstracted by the collection or parametrisation mechanisms. In this
case, ensure that you are not trying to make assumptions on the type
 of a collection parameter or a collection.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Type $t_1$ occurs in $t_2$ and would lead to a cycle.}
{\em Description}: The {\focal} type system does not allow cyclic
types. This especially means that a type expression must not be a
sub-part of itself to prevent cycles.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Type constructor '$name$' used with conflicting arities:
  $n_1$ and $n_2$.}
{\em Description}: A type expression applies a type constructor $name$
to $n_1$ argument(s) although its definition declared it as using $n_2$
argument(s) (or in the other order, depending on the way the error was
detected: in any way the definition and the usage of the type involve
2 different numbers of arguments).

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{No expected argument(s).}
{\em Description}: A type expression applies a type constructor to
arguments although this constructor needs none.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{In method '$name$', type scheme $sch$ contains free variables.}

{\em Description}: As presented in \ref{no-polymorphism-for-methods},
species methods cannot be polymorphic. The method $name$ has a
 type scheme shown by $sch$  which is polymorphic.

{\em Hints}:  You may explicitly add type
annotations (constraints) on the arguments or/and return type of your
method definition. If you need some kind of such polymorphism, use the
collection parameter mechanism.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Sum type  value constructor '$name$' expected $n_1$ arguments but
  was used with $n_2$ arguments.}

{\em Description}: The sum type constructor $name$ is used with a bad
number of arguments. It was declared to use $n_1$ arguments but is
used with $n_2$.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unbound type variable $name$.}

{\em Description}: In a type expression, a type variable $name$ is not
bound.

{\em Hints}: Source program to fix. May be the type expression appears
in a parametrised type definition where you forgot to specify the type
constructor's parameter in head of the definition.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Method '$mname$' multiply defined in species '$sname$'.}

{\em Description}: Like for toplevel definitions, method definitions
inside a species must not bind several times the same name. In the
species $sname$, the method $mname$ is defined several times.

{\em Hints}: Source program to fix. May be you defined several times
the same method and in this case, remove one of the definitions. Or if
the different occurrences of $mname$ refer to different conceptual
functions, change the names to make them different.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Delayed proof  of '$name$' was found several times in the
  species. Other occurrence is at: $loc$.}

{\em Description}: A delayed proof of the property $name$ was found
several times in the same species (i.e. not via inheritance but
directly in the species body). Only one must be kept.


{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{In species '$sname$', proof of '$pname$' is not related to
  an existing property.}

{\em Description}: In the species $sname$ a delayed proof of the
property $pname$ was found but the statement of this property doesn't
exist in the current species even via inheritance.


{\em Hints}: May be you forgot to write the property, or you mistook
on the property name the proof is related to or you forgot to inherit
from a species having this property.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Representation is multiply defined.}

{\em Description}: In a species, the method {\tt representation} is
multiply defined in the body of the species although at most one
definition must be provided.

{\em Hints}: Source program to fix. Remove the spurious definitions.

If the {\tt representation} method is not directly present in the
body, that is because the species inherits from a parent where the
representation is already defined. In this last case, since the parent's
structure is already established, you must remove the {\tt representation} method
in the species where the error was reported.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Representation is multiply defined by multiple
  inheritance and was formerly found of type $t_1$ and newly found of
  type $t_2$.}

{\em Description}: In the species, several parents brought by
inheritance several incompatible definitions of the representation. The error message reports $t_1$ and $t_2$, two incompatible
types found for the representation definition.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{'Self' can't be parametrised by itself.}

{\em Description}: This error appears when {\tt Self} appears as a
species identifier used in a species expression that is a parameter of
the current defined species.

% {\color{red} Unsure, not appearing raised anymore. Check if this is
%   for further analysis or if it is a remaining spurious stuff.}


{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{A "is" parameter can only be instantiated by an identifier of a collection.}

{\em Description}: In a species expression, a parametrised species by
an entity parameter ({\tt is}-parameter) is provided an effective
argument that is not a collection identifier.

% {\em Hints}: Source program to fix. Although a collection parameter
% denotes a {\bf value} (and not a {\bf collection} like for
% {\tt is}-parameters), this value must have the {\bf type} of a
% collection interface. Hence in a species expression, a
% {\tt in}-parameter) must be instantiated by a {\tt collection}
% identifier.
{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Illegal use of toplevel species '$S$' as effective argument.}

{\em Description}: Effective parameter in species expressions (for inheritance
or collection implementation) can only be collections or collection
parameters. In the present case, a toplevel species was used instead which
is inconsistent.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Collection '$s_1$' is not compatible with '$s_2$'. In method
  '$name$', types $t_1$ and $t_2$ are not compatible.}

{\em Description}: During collection parameter instantiation, the
interface of the provided collection  $s_1$ is not compatible with the
interface  $s_2$, because it doesn't have a signature containing at
least $s_2$'s methods with compatibles types. The wrong field $name$
is reported with the two types $t_1$ and $t_2$ expected and actually
found.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Collection '$s_1$' is not compatible with '$s_2$'. In method
  '$fname$', type $t_1$ occurs in $t_2$ and would lead to a cycle.}

{\em Description}: During collection parameter instantiation, the interface
of the provided collection $s_1$ is not compatible with the interface $s_2$,
since type compatibility check detected a cyclic type. This means that the
type $t_1$ is a sub-part of itself via the type $t_2$.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Collection  '$s_1$' is not compatible with '$s_2$'. In method
  '$fname$', the type constructor '$tname$' is used with the different
  arities $n_1$ and $n_2$.}

{\em Description}: During collection parameter instantiation, the interface
of the provided collection $s_1$ is not compatible with the interface $s_2$,
since the type constructor (not sum type constructor) $tname$ is used with an
improper number of arguments $n_1$ versus $n_2$.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Collection  '$s_1$' is not compatible with  '$s_2$'.  Method '$name$'
  is not present in '$s_1$'.}

{\em Description}: During collection parameter instantiation, the interface
of the provided collection $s_1$ is not compatible with the interface $s_2$,
because it doesn't have a signature containing at least $s_2$'s methods and
especially not the method $name$.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Parameterised species is applied to $n$ arguments.}

{\em Description}: A parameterised species is applied to a wrong
number $n$ of effective arguments.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Species '$sname$' cannot be turned into a collection. Following
 field(s) is(are) not defined: ...}

{\em Description}: A collection is built  out of a  completely defined species
(cf. \ref{collection}), i.e. a species where {\bf all} the methods
are {\bf defined} and not only declared. In the species $sname$, the
listed methods are only declared (or missing a termination proof in case of
recursive functions and usage of the {\tt -impose-termination-proof}).
Hence the species is not complete and no collection can be extracted
from it.

Note that missing termination is by default only a {\bf warning} and
is turned into an error by using the {\tt -impose-termination-proof}
option on the command line. In effect, the notion of to ``be defined''
applies to recursive functions which must have a termination proof
provided in addition to their computational body.

{\em Hints}: Add an effective definition of the method, either by
writing it code or by inheritance, according to your program model.

Add an effective termination proof to the function or do
not invoke the {\tt -impose-termination-proof} option when compiling
the source file.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Warning: In species '$sname_1$', proof of '$pname$' could be done
  earlier in '$sname_2$'.}

{\em Description}: This message is only a {\bf warning}. It states
that the property $pname$ whose proof was done in the species
$sname_1$ could be proved earlier in the inheritance (mor eaccurately,
in the species $sname_2$ from which $sname_1$ inherits) because all
the material used in the proof was already available in the species
$sname_2$. This espacially means that all the methods the proof
{\bf def}-depends on were alrady {\bf defined}, and all the methods
the proof {\bf decl}-depends on were already {\bf declared}.

{\em Hints}: Move the proof of the property directly in the species
$sname_2$. If the property is also hosted in $sname_2$, then it can
directly be turned into a theorem, merging the 2 fields {\tt property}
and {\tt proof of}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{In the delayed termination proof, parameter '$name$' does
  not refer to a parameter of the original function.}

{\em Description}: As any proof, termination proofs can be made later
after the function definition. However it must refer to the original
function's parameters names. In the current proof, the identifier
$name$ doesn't exist among the original function's parameters.

{\em Hints}: Change the parameter name in the proof to make it
matching the function definition's ones.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Method '$mname$' was found with incompatible types during
  inheritance. In species '$s_1$': $\tau_1$, in species '$s_2$':
  $\tau_2$.}

{\em Description}: During inheritance, a method $nmane$ was found with
2 incompatible types. Remind that all along the inheritance tree,
methods must not change their type. The two found types and the
species hosting the definitions having these types are provided by
'$s_1$'and $\tau_1$ (resp. '$s_2$'and $\tau_2$).

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Logical method '$mname$' appearing in species '$s_1$' should
  have the same statement than in species '$s_2$' at
  $source-location$.}

{\em Description}: During inheritance, a theorem or a property $nmane$
was redefined but with a different statement. As described at the
beginning of \ref{inheritance}, the inheritance mechanism also allows
to redefine methods already existing as long as they keep the same
type expression.  For theorems to have the same type is simply to have
the same statement. A same property can be written in several
semantically equivalent ways. For instance, transitivity of an
operation $\odot$ can be written by:
$\forall x, y, z \in S, x \odot y \Rightarrow y \odot z \Rightarrow
x \odot z$
or
$\forall x, y, z \in S, (x \odot y \wedge y \odot z) \Rightarrow
x \odot z$.
{\focal} does not try to establish the equality of these two
expressions. It only compares syntactically the statements modulo
variables renaming (i.e. $\alpha$-conversion) and non-significant
parentheses.

{\em Hints}: The simplest way is to rewrite the logical statement of
the inheriting species as it was written in the inherited species.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Definition '$name$' is considered as both  logical and
  non-logical.}

{\em Description}: In the inheritance tree of the current species, a
method $name$ was previously found a ``logical'' and is now found no
more ``logical''.

{\em Hints}: Ensure that you did not define 2 methods with the same
name but for different purposes (one to help in stating logical
expressions and the other for your computational behaviour).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Definition '$name$' is redefined although marked final.}

{\em Description}: In the inheritance tree of the current species, a
method $name$ was previously defined with the keyword {\tt final} forbidding
any later redefinition while the current species try to redefine it.

{\em Hints}: If the previous definition was flagged as to be never changed,
there may have good reasons. Try to understand while the software architecture
imposed this constraint (before -- may be dangerously-- thinking at removing the
{\tt final} qualifier!).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Species 'sname' is not well-formed. Method  '$name$' involves
  a non-declared recursion for the following dependent methods: \ldots}

{\em Description}: The species $sname$ doesn't respect the
well-formation rule presented in \ref{well-formation}. The chain of
functions involved in the cycle is given in the error message as a
sequence of methods names
$m_1 \rightarrow m_2 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow m_n$ with the
implicit final path $m_n \rightarrow m_1$.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{No $lang$ mapping given for the external value definition
  '$name$'.}

{\em Description}: The external value definition allowing to link
{\focal} code to foreign languages doesn't specify how to map the value
identifier $name$ in the language $lang$.

{\em Hints}: Supply a binding for this language in the external
definition.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{No $lang$ mapping given for the external type definition
  '$name$'.}

{\em Description}: The external type definition allowing to link
{\focal} code to foreign languages doesn't specify how to map the type
identifier $name$ in the language $lang$.

{\em Hints}: Supply a binding for this language in the external
definition.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{No $lang$ mapping given for the external sum type value
  constructor '$name$'.}

{\em Description}: The external sum type definition allowing to link
{\focal} code to foreign languages doesn't specify how to map the sum
type constructor $name$ in the language $lang$.

{\em Hints}: Supply a binding for this language in the external
definition.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{No $lang$ mapping given for the external record field
  '$name$'.}

{\em Description}: The external record type definition allowing to
link {\focal} code to foreign languages doesn't specify how to map the
record field $name$ in the language $lang$.

{\em Hints}: Supply a binding for this language in the external
definition.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unable to find OCaml generation information for compiled
  file '$file$'. Compilation unit may have been compiled without OCaml code
  generation enabled.}

{\em Description}: The {\focal} compilation unit file $file$.fcl was compiled but
the object file doesn't contain information about {\ocaml} code
generation. The {\focal} compiler allows to disable the {\ocaml} code
production by the {\tt --no-ocaml-code} option. May be this option was used.

{\em Hints}: Invoke the compiler on the source file $file$.fcl without
the {\tt --no-ocaml-code} option.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Record type definition contains a mutable field '$name$' that can't
  be compiled to Coq.}

{\em Description}: {\color{red} Never raised in the current version
  since mutable record fields are not yet available}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unable to find Coq generation information for compiled file
  '$file$'. Compilation unit may have been compiled without Coq code
  generation enabled.}

{\em Description}: The {\focal} compilation unit $file$.fcl was
compiled but the object file doesn't contain information about {\coq}
code generation. The {\focal} compiler allows to disable the {\coq} code
production by the {\tt --no-coq-code} option. May be this option was
used.

{\em Hints}: Invoke the compiler on the source file $file$.fcl without
the {\tt --no-coq-code} option.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Using a collection parameter's method ($name$) in a Zenon proof
  with "by definition" is not allowed.}

{\em Description}: The current proof tries to used the definition of a
method $name$ of a species parameter. Since species parameters are
always abstracted, {\bf definitions} (i.e. ``bodies'') of their methods
are {\bf not} available in the parametrised species. For this reason,
it is impossible to provide this definition to {\zenon}.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Using an only declared method of Self ($name$) in a Zenon
  proof with "by definition" is not allowed.}

{\em Description}: The current proof tries to used the definition of a
method $name$ {\bf only declared} in the current species. Since the
definition is not available, it is impossible to provide it to
{\zenon}.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Using a local identifier ($name$) in a Zenon proof with "by
  definition" is not allowed.}

{\em Description}: The current proof tries to used a local variable
$name$, i.e. an identifier not representing a method, hence
meaningless for {\zenon}.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Using a local identifier ($name$) in a Zenon proof with "by
  property" is not allowed.}

{\em Description}: The current proof tries to used a local variable
$name$, i.e. an identifier not representing a method, hence
meaningless for {\zenon}.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Assumed hypothesis '$hyp$' in a Zenon proof was not found.}

{\em Description}: The current proof makes a reference to an
hypothesis $hyp$ that was not found in the current proof tree.

{\em Hints}: None.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Step '$<$\ldots$>$\ldots' in a Zenon proof was not found.}

{\em Description}: The current proof makes a reference to an
proof step that was not found in the current proof tree.

{\em Hints}: None.

\section*{Mutual recursion is not yet supported for Coq code
  generation. At least functions '$name_1$' and '$name_2$' are
  involved in a mutual recursion.}

{\em Description}: The current version of {\focal} does not yet handle
{\coq} code generation for mutual recursive functions. At least the two
functions $name_1$ and $name_2$ were found as mutually recursive but
may be the recursion involves more functions. It is then impossible to
produce {\coq} source code.


{\em Hints}: Until this feature is available in {\focal}, do not try to
generate the {\coq} code for the source file containing these functions
by using the {\tt --no-coq-code} option.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Recursive call to '$name$' contains nested recursion.}

{\em Description}: The function contains a recursive call to $name$
inside a recursive call. The current version of {\focal} doesn't
support the {\coq} code generation for nested recursive calls.

{\em Hints}: Try to rewrite your function with the nested call
performed before the outer recursive call. For instance:
{\scriptsize
\begin{lstlisting}
let rec f (x) =
  ...
  f (f (bla))
  ...
\end{lstlisting}
}
should be turned into:
{\scriptsize
\begin{lstlisting}
let rec f (x) =
  ...
  let tmp = f (bla) in
  f (tmp)
  ...
\end{lstlisting}
}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Recursive call to '$name$' is incomplete.}

{\em Description}: The function contains a recursive occurrence of
$name$ with an incomplete number of parameters. Since application
syntactically requires all the arguments to be present, this can arise
if the recursive identifier is used in non-applicative
position. However the error message is more general since future
extensions may involve partial applications. Below follows an example
of such invalid usage of a recursive function identifier:
{\scriptsize
\begin{lstlisting}
let rec f (x) =
  ...
  let tmp = f in
  let ...  = tmp (...) ... in
  f (...)
  ...
\end{lstlisting}
}

{\em Hints}: None


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Pattern-matching is not exhaustive.}

{\em Description}: The pointed pattern-matching expression doesn't
handle all the shapes of possible incoming values according to the
type of the matched expression. If such a non-handled value arises at
runtime, execution will be aborted. Moreover, {\coq} will reject
generated code.

{\em Hints}: Complete the pattern-matching by adding cases covering
all the possible shapes of values. Inspect the type definition related
to the matched expression to find the missing constructors. The
ultimate {\em bullet-proof} solution is to add a ``catch-all''
pattern, although it is not always the suitable solution: study if all
the remaining cases require the same process.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Useless case in pattern-matching.}

{\em Description}: The pointed pattern-matching expression contains a
case already caught by a previous one. Hence, this useless case will
never be followed.

{\em Hints}: Remove the spurious case. But before, make sure you
didn't write above a pattern using a variable instead of a value
constructor. Another common error is to use in a pattern, a variable wearing
the same name than a previously bound one, thinking that
pattern-matching will test equality of the matched value with the
value of this previously bound variable. For instance:

{\scriptsize
\begin{lstlisting}
let var = 3 in
match (var + 0) with
  | var -> false
  | _ -> true
\end{lstlisting}}

\noindent will {\bf not} check that the matched value ($4$) is equal to the
value of \lstinline"var". In the pattern, \lstinline"var" is a new
identifier that will be bound to the value of the matched expression,
here to $3$. Hence, in this case the first branch is always taken, leaving the
second one useless.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Unexpected error: "$msg$". Please report.}

{\em Description}: An error was raised and not expected during a
normal execution of the compiler. This is a failure of the compiler
and must be fixed by the {\focal} development team. The error message
display the internal reason of the failure and must be reported to the
{\focal} development team.

{\em Hints}: \verb+http://focal.inria.fr/+, link ``Bug tracking''.
