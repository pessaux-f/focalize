 The \focal\ project was launched in 1998 by T. Hardin and R. Rioboo
\cite{HardinRiobooTSI04} with the 
objective of helping all stages of development of critical software
within safety and security framework, at least when formal methods are
required or chosen. The idea was to elaborate a development
environment able to provide high-level and justified confidence to
users. One the other hand, this system had to remain easy to use by
well-trained engineers.

Currently, \focal\ can be seen as still a prototype of an Integrated
Development Environment (IDE), for a language providing high level
mechanisms such as inheritance, late binding, redefinition,
parametrization, etc.  Confidence in proofs submitted by developers
relies on formal proof verification.

This support language was formally described and designed to provide
means for formal specification by declaring names and
properties. Then, design and implementation can incrementally be done
by adding definitions of functions and proving that the implementation
meets the specification or design requirements. Thus, developing in
\focal\ is a kind of refinement process from  formal model to design
and code, completely done within \focal. Taking the global development
in consideration within a same environment brings some conciseness,
helps documentation and reviewing.

A \focal\ development is organised as a hierarchy that may have
several roots. The upper levels of the hierarchy are built along the
specification stage while the lower ones correspond to
implementation. Each node of the hierarchy corresponds to a progress
toward a complete implementation.  We call here {\em refinement} the
process of building a top-down hierarchy.
