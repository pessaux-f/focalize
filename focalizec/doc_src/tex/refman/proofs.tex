\section{Proofs of  theorems}
As presented in \ref{proof-short-intro}, {\focal} proposes 3 ways to
make proof of properties. We will only deal here with proofs written
in the {\focal} Proof Language. As a reminder, proofs written as
direct {\coq} scripts will be addressed in \ref{coq-proofs}. And the
last kind of proof, by {\tt assumed} doesn't need anymore description
since it consists in bypassing the formal proof mechanism.

The syntax of proofs is as follows.
\begin{syntax}
\syntaxclass{Proofs:}
proof & ::=  & {proof\_step*} qed\_step \\
      & \mid & \terminal{by}\ fact* \\
      & \mid & \terminal{conclude}
\end{syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\syntaxclass{Proof steps:}
proof\_step & ::=  & proof\_bullet~~statement~~proof
\end{syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\syntaxclass{QED steps:}
qed\_step & ::=  & proof\_bullet\ \terminal{qed}\ proof \\
          & \mid & proof\_bullet\ \terminal{conclude}
\end{syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\syntaxclass{Statements:}
statement & ::=  & {\{\terminal{assume}\ logical\_expr\ \terminal{,}\}*}
                   \{\terminal{prove}\ logical\_expr\}?
\end{syntax}
A statement must be non-empty: at least one \terminal{assume} or the
\terminal{prove} part must be present.

\begin{syntax}
\syntaxclass{Facts:}
fact & ::= & 
\end{syntax}
