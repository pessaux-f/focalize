\section{Required software}
\label{required-software}
To be able to develop with the {\focal} environment, a few third party
tools are required. All of them can be freely downloaded from their
related website.
\begin{compact-itemize}
  \item The Objective Caml compiler (version $\geq$ 3.10.2). \\
    Available
    at \verb+http://caml.inria.fr+. This will be used to compile both
    the {\focal} system at installation stage from the tarball and
    the {\focal} compiler's output generated by the compilation of
    your {\focal} programs.

  \item The Coq Proof Assistant (version $\geq$ 8.1pl4). \\
     Available at
    \verb+http://coq.inria.fr+. This will be used to compile both
    the {\focal} libraries at installation stage from the tarball and
    the {\focal} compiler's output generated by the compilation of
    your {\focal} programs.
\end{compact-itemize}

Note that some distributions of {\focal} includes these tools and are
automatically installed during the {\focal} installation process.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Optional software}
\label{optional-software}
The {\focal} compiler can generate dependencies graphs from compiled
source code. It generates them in the format suitable to be processed
and displayed by the {\dotty} tools suite of the ``Graphwiz'' package. If
you plan to examine these graphs, you also need to install this
software from \verb+http://www.graphviz.org/+.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Operating systems}
{\focal} was fully developed under Linux using free software. Hence,
any Unix-based operating system should support {\focal}. The currently
tested Unix are: Fedora, Debian, Suse, BSD.

Windows users can run {\focal} via the Unix-like
environment {\cygwin} providing both users and developers tools. This
software is freely distributed and available
at \verb+http://www.cygwin.com/+.

\smallskip
\paragraph*{From the official {\cygwin} web site:}
``{\em Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows. It consists of
two parts: A DLL (cygwin1.dll) which acts as a Linux API emulation
layer providing substantial Linux API functionality. A collection of
tools which provide Linux look and feel.
\smallskip
The Cygwin DLL currently works with all recent, commercially released
x86 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Windows, with the exception of
Windows CE.
\smallskip
Cygwin is not a way to run native linux apps on Windows. You have to
rebuild your application from source if you want it to run on
Windows.

Cygwin is not a way to magically make native Windows apps aware of
UNIX ® functionality, like signals, ptys, etc. Again, you need to
build your apps from source if you want to take advantage of Cygwin
functionality.}''

\medskip
Under \cygwin, the required packages are the same as those listed
in \ref{required-software} and \ref{optional-software}. As stated
in \cygwin's citation above, you need to get the sources packages of
this software and compile them yourself, following information
provided in these packages.

The installation of {\focal} itself is the same for all operating
systems and is described in the following section
(\ref{installation}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Installation}
\label{installation}
\index{installation}
{\focal} is currently distributed as a tarball containing the whole
source code of the development environment. You must first deflate the
archive (a directory will be created) by:
\begin{center}
{\tt tar xvzf focalize-x.y.z.tgz}
\end{center}
Where $x.y.z$ is the version number. Next, go in the sources directory:
\begin{center}
{\tt cd focalize-x.x.x/}
\end{center}
You now must configure the build process by:
\begin{center}
{\tt ./configure}
\end{center}
The configuration script then asks for directories where to install
the {\focal} components. You may just press enter to keep the default
installation directories.
\begin{verbatim}
latour:~/src/focalize$ ./configure ~/pkg
Where to install FoCaLiZe binaries ?
Default is /usr/local/bin.
Just press enter to use default location.

Where to install FoCaLiZe libraries ?
Default is /usr/local/lib/focalize.
Just press enter to use default location.
\end{verbatim}
After the configuration ends, just build the system:
\begin{center}
{\tt make all}
\end{center}
And finally, get root priviledges to install the {\focal} system:
\begin{center}
{\tt su}\\
{\tt make install}
\end{center}
