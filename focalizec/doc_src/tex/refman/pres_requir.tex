This manual describes the main constructions of the \focal\ language,
as well as the main tools given by the \focal\ environment. Basic
expressions of the \focal\ language are quite similar to the core
expressions of \ocaml\
({\tt http://caml.inria.fr}).A prior knowledge of some functional
languages might be helpful to better understand the \focal's core
language concepts. Last a good knowledge of \coq\ is needed if you
intend to manually write proofs in \focal\. However, this task may be
helped by the \zenon\ automated theorem prover, as long as the user
write his proofs using the \focal\ Proof Language embedded in the
\focal\ language.
