This manual describes the main constructions of the \focal\ language,
as well as the main tools given by the \focal\ environment. Basic
expressions of the \focal\ language are quite similar to the core
expressions of \ocaml\
(\verb+http://caml.inria.fr+). A prior knowledge of some functional
languages might be helpful to better understand the \focal's core
language concepts. Last a good knowledge of \coq\ is needed if you
intend to manually write proofs in \focal{}. However, this task may be
helped by the \zenon\ automated theorem prover, as long as the user
write his proofs using the \focal\ Proof Language embedded in the
\focal\ language.

\section{Required software}
\label{required-software}
To be able to develop with the \focal\ environment, a few third party
tools are required. All of them can be freely downloaded from their
related website.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Objective Caml compiler (version $\geq$ 3.09pl3). \\
    Available
    at \verb+http://caml.inria.fr+. This will be used to compile both
    the \focal\ system at installation stage from the tarball and
    the \focal\ compiler's output generated by the compilation of
    your \focal\ programs.

  \item The Coq Proof Assistant (version $\geq$ 8.1pl3). \\
     Available at
    \verb+http://coq.inria.fr+. This will be used to compile both
    the \focal\ libraries at installation stage from the tarball and
    the \focal\ compiler's output generated by the compilation of
    your \focal\ programs.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Optional software}
\label{optional-software}
The \focal\ compiler can generate dependencies graphs from compiled
source code. It generates them in the format suitable to be processed
and displayed by the \dotty\ tools suit of the ``Graphwiz'' package. If
you plan to examine these graphs, you also need to install this
software from \verb+http://www.graphviz.org/+.

\section{Operating systems}
\focal\ was fully developed under Linux using free software. Hence,
any Unix-based operating system should support \focal. The currently
tested Unix are: Fedora, Debian, Suse, BSD.

Windows users can run \focal\ via the Unix-like
environment \cygwin providing both users and developers tools. This
software is freely distributed and available
at \verb+http://www.cygwin.com/+.

\smallskip
\paragraph*{From the official \cygwin\ web site:}
``{\em Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows. It consists of
two parts: A DLL (cygwin1.dll) which acts as a Linux API emulation
layer providing substantial Linux API functionality. A collection of
tools which provide Linux look and feel.
\smallskip
The Cygwin DLL currently works with all recent, commercially released
x86 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Windows, with the exception of
Windows CE.
\smallskip
Cygwin is not a way to run native linux apps on Windows. You have to
rebuild your application from source if you want it to run on
Windows.

Cygwin is not a way to magically make native Windows apps aware of
UNIX ® functionality, like signals, ptys, etc. Again, you need to
build your apps from source if you want to take advantage of Cygwin
functionality.}''

\medskip
Under \cygwin, the required packages are the same as those listed
in \ref{required-software} and \ref{optional-software}. As stated
in \cygwin's citation above, you need to get the sources packages of
this software and compile them yourself, following information
provided in these packages.

The installation of \focal\ itself is the same for all operating
systems and is described in the following section
(\ref{installation}).

\section{Installation}
\label{installation}
\index{installation}
\focal\ is currently distributed as a tarball containing the whole
source code of the development environment. You must first deflate the
archive (a directory will be created) by:
\begin{center}
{\tt tar xvzf focalize-x.x.x.tgz}
\end{center}
Next, go in the sources directory:
\begin{center}
{\tt cd focalize-x.x.x/}
\end{center}
You now must configure the build process by:
\begin{center}
{\tt ./configure}
\end{center}
The configuration script then asks for directories where to install
the \focal\ components. You may just press enter to keep the default
installation directories.
\begin{verbatim}
diddle:~/devel/ssurf/focal/focalize$ ./configure 
Where to install FoCaL binaries ?
Default is /usr/local/bin.
Just press enter to use default location.

Where to install FoCaL libraries ?
Default is /usr/local/lib/focalize.
Just press enter to use default location.
\end{verbatim}
After the configuration ends, just build the system:
\begin{center}
{\tt make all}
\end{center}
And finally, be root to install the built \focal\ system:
\begin{center}
{\tt su}\\
{\tt make install}
\end{center}
