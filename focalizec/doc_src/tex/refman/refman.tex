{\Huge \textbf{About {\focal}}}
\end{center}

\bigskip

{\large\em {\focal} is the result of a collective work of several researchers,
listed in the following, who designed, defined, compiled, studied,  extended,
used and debugged the preceding versions. They were helped by many
students who had a summer internship under their supervision. They
would like to thank all these students and more generally all the
persons who brought some contribution to {\focal}.}

The {\foc} project was first partially supported by LIP6 (Projet Foc, LIP6
1997) then by the Ministry of Research (Action Modulogic).
The {\oldfocal} research team was then partially supported by the French SSURF ANR project
ANR-06-SETI-016 (Safety and Security UndeR Focal). The project also
benefited of strong collaborations with the EDEMOI ANR project and with the
BERTIN and SAFERIVER companies.

The {\focal} language and compiler development effort started around 2005.
The architecture conception and code rewritting started from scratch in 2006
to finally make the first {\focalizec} compiler and {\focal} system
distribution in 2009, January.

This manual documents the completely revised system with the new syntax and
its semantics extensions.
