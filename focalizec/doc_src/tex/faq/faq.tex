{\Huge \textbf{\focal} FAQ}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{faqitem}
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ Q:}
I get the error message:\\
  \verb+Error: The reference basics.int__t was not found in the current+\\
  \verb+environment+\\
when \coq\ compiles.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\medskip
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ A:}
You probably forgot to open the module {\tt basics} in you \focal\ program.
Add the directive \lstinline{open "basics" ;;} at the top of your source
file.
\end{faqitem}

\begin{faqitem}
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ Q:}
I get the error message:\\
  \verb+Error: Types Self and ... are not compatible.+\\
when \focalizec\ compiles.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\medskip
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ A:}
You probably have created a def-dedendency on the
representation in the statement of a property or a theorem, like in:
{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
species Bug =
  representation = int ;
  property wrong : all x : Self, x = x + 0 ;
end ;;
\end{lstlisting}}


This statement reveals that the representation is indeed {\tt int} since to
have \lstinline"x + 0" well-typed, {\tt Self} must exactly be {\tt int}. This
makes the interface of the species impossible to be typed as a collection
since the representation will be abstracted. You may need to add extra methods
hidding the dependency on representation.

\begin{faqitem}
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ Q:}
How to I make a function taking a tuple in argument ?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\medskip
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ A:}
\lstinline"let f ( (x, y) ) = ... ;;"
\end{faqitem}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\bigskip
\begin{faqitem}
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ Q:}
How to I make a function taking {\tt unit} in argument ?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\medskip
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ A:}
\lstinline"let f (_x : unit) = ... ;;"
\end{faqitem}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\bigskip
\begin{faqitem}
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ Q:}
What is the difference between a constructor having several
arguments and a constructor having one argument being a tuple ?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\medskip
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ A:}
A constructor with one argument being a tuple is defined using the ``tupling''
type constructor \lstinline{*}:
{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
type with_1_tuple_arg = 
  | A (int * bool * string) ;;   (* Note the stars. *)
\end{lstlisting}}

A valid usage of this construtor is:
{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
let ok = A ( (1, false, "") ) ;;
\end{lstlisting}}

\noindent where it is important to note the double parentheses. This
constructor has 1 argument that is a tuple. The syntax for constructors with
arguments already requires parentheses, that's the reason for these double
parentheses.

Trying to use this constructor as:

{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
let ko = A (1, false, "") ;;
\end{lstlisting}}

\noindent would lead to an error telling that types {\tt int * bool * string}
and {\tt int} are not compatible. In effect in this case, {\tt A} is
considered to be applied to several arguments, the first one being {\tt 1}
that is of type {\tt int}. And {\tt int} is really incompatible with a tuple
type.

A similar constructor with several separate arguments is defined using
the ``comma'' construct:

{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
type with_several_args =
  | B (int, bool, string) ;;   (* Note the comas. *)
\end{lstlisting}}

A valid usage of this construtor is:
{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
let ok = B (1, false, "") ;;
\end{lstlisting}}

\noindent where it is important to note the unique pair of parentheses. This
constructor has 3 arguments.

Trying to use this constructor as:

{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
let ko = B ( (1, false, "") ) ;;
\end{lstlisting}}

\noindent would lead to an error telling that types {\tt int} and
{\tt int * bool * string} are not compatible. In effect, we try to pass to
{\tt B} one unique argument that is a tuple. And a tuple is incompatible with
the first expected argument of {\tt B}, that is {\tt int}.
\end{faqitem}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\bigskip
\begin{faqitem}
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ Q:}
I get a syntax error on a sum type definition or a pattern-matching.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\medskip
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ A:}
Beware that conversely to \ocaml, the first bar is not optional in \focal.

\begin{minipage}{6.2cm}
Wrong
{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
type t =
    Z
  | S (t) ;;

match x with
    Z -> ...
  | S (y) ...
\end{lstlisting}}
\end{minipage}\hskip1cm
\begin{minipage}{6.2cm}
Correct
{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
type t =
  | Z
  | S (t) ;;

match x with
  | Z -> ...
  | S (y) ...
\end{lstlisting}}
\end{minipage}
\end{faqitem}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\bigskip
\begin{faqitem}
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ Q:}
I get the error message:\\
  \verb+Zenon error: uncaught exception File "coqterm.ml", line +\\
  \verb+325, characters 6-12: Assertion failed+

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\medskip
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ A:}
This is a current issue in \zenon. Compile your program
adding the option \verb+-zvtovopt -script+ to \focalizec. This asks
\zenon\ to output proofs as a \coq\ script instead of a \coq\ term. This should
be fixed in the future.
\end{faqitem}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\bigskip
\begin{faqitem}
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ Q:}
I get the error message:\\
  \verb+Error: Types coq_builtins#prop and basics#bool are not compatible.+

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\medskip
\noindent {\bf $\bullet$ A:}
You confused the ``not'' operators \lstinline"~" and \lstinline"~~" or
probably used a \lstinline"logical let" definition in a \lstinline"let"
definition like in the following example.

{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
species Bug =
  logical let not0 (x) = ~~ (x = 0) ;
  let g (y) = if not0 (y) then ... else ... ;
end ;;
\end{lstlisting}}

\lstinline"logical let" are definitions whose result type is {\tt prop}, i.e.
the type of logical {\bf statement}. They are intended to be used in theorems
or properties and are discarded in \ocaml\ code since this latter doesn't
deal with logical/proof aspects. The type of logical {\bf expressions} is
{\tt bool} and is automatically transformed into {\tt prop} in the context
of logical statements of theorems or properties. However, in the context of
computational definitions, {\tt prop} is always rejected. In the above example,
you may have defined the {\em computational} function {\tt not0} by:

{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
species Bug =
  let not0 (x) = ~ (x = 0) ;
  let g (y) = if not0 (y) then ... else ... ;
end ;;
\end{lstlisting}}

\noindent where \lstinline"~" is the ``not'' on booleans, whereas
\lstinline"~~" is the ``not'' on logical propositions.
