\section{Conclusion}
This tutorial illustrated the way proofs can be carried out in \focal,
using \zenon\ to make them easier. We addressed here development much
more ``algorithm-oriented'' than other documents more oriented toward
``mathematical-modeling''.

We didn't used powerful modeling constructs of \focal\ to only
concentrate on hierarchical split of proofs, intermediate lemmas
stating and kind of facts available to guide \zenon\ in its proofs
searches and in which case to use them.
